# 🍪 Cookie Co. - Interactive Cookie Website (Hackathon Project)

This project was created as part of the **Tata 1mg Hackathon**, where the focus was on **frontend excellence**, **animation**, and **UI/UX design**. The project showcases smooth scroll-based animations using GSAP and Locomotive Scroll, while following design standards offered by the **Catalyst** design system.



## 🚀 Tech Stack Used

- **React.js** – Frontend framework for building the UI.
- **SCSS/CSS** – For styling and layout of the pages.
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** – For scroll-triggered animations and element transitions.
- **ScrollTrigger (GSAP plugin)** – To bind animations to scroll behavior.
- **Locomotive Scroll** – For smooth scrolling and custom scroll handling.
- **Catalyst by Tata 1mg** – Design system providing components, colors, and layout structure.

## 🧪 What is Catalyst?

**Catalyst** is the official **design system and component library by Tata 1mg**. It provides developers with:

- Predefined **color schemes**, **typography**, and **spacing tokens**.
- Ready-to-use **React UI components** that are accessible and responsive.
- Standardized design tokens to keep branding and design consistent.

In this project, the **visual structure**, color palette, and spacing were inspired by Catalyst’s design principles, ensuring consistency and aesthetic appeal.
